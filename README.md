# Discount Code App

This is a simple React TypeScript application with Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes:

- Radio buttons to select between options
- A text box for entering and validating discount codes
- A button to generate a mock discount code
- A text area for entering notes

## Features

1. **Radio Selection Buttons**:

   - Allows the user to select between three options ("Option A", "Option B", "Option C").
   - The selected option is stored in the application's state.

2. **Text Box for Discount Code Entry**:

   - Allows users to enter a discount code.
   - Includes basic validation to check if the entered text follows the pattern `DISCOUNTXXXXX`.

3. **Button to Simulate Discount Code Generation**:

   - Generates a mock discount code (e.g., `DISCOUNT1234`) and displays it to the user.

4. **Basic Note Field**:
   - Allows users to enter notes or comments.
   - The entered text is accessible in the application's state.
